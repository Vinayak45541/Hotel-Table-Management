# Hotel Table Management

A full-stack restaurant table management system built with React (Vite) and Node.js. Designed to streamline table reservations, availability tracking, and hotel management operations.

## 🚀 Overview
This system allows hotel/restaurant staff to:
- Manage table availability
- Handle reservations and seating status
- Monitor hotel data across interfaces
- Maintain menus and other details (if enabled)

The project is cleanly separated into **frontend** and **backend** for scalability.

## ✨ Features
- Table availability tracking (Free / Reserved / Occupied)
- Booking workflow with status updates
- Manager/Admin view to monitor all tables
- Frontend + Backend communication via REST APIs
- JSON-based data storage (optional database integration)
- Responsive UI (desktop/tablet friendly)

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React (Vite)
- React Router
- Axios (for API calls)
- CSS (replace with Tailwind/Bootstrap if applicable)

**Backend**
- Node.js + Express
- REST API architecture
- `hoteldata.json` and `menudata.json` as data sources (replaceable with DB)
- Environment variables for configuration
